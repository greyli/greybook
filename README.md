$ cd greybook
```

Install dependencies with [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev):

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have PDM installed, you can create a virtual environment with `venv` and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To initialize the app, run the `flask init-blog` command:

```
$ pdm run flask init-blog

If you just want to try it out, generate fake data with `flask lorem` command:

```
$ pdm run flask lorem

It will create a test account:

* username: `admin`
* password: `greybook`

Now you can run the app:

```
$ pdm run flask run
